Hello! Brookie here!

So I've been working a while on this web port of Legend of Tenna - the NES game from Deltarune Chapter 3.
I've gotten a _LOT_ of progress done already!

**Right now, this project has**:
* Every single used or unused quiz in chapter 3
* A full interactable version of Board 1
* Character customization

**Developer Notes**:
I sincerely apologize if anyone thinks this port is _too blurry_. Gamemaker \(the program I'm coding this in\) is kinda picky when it comes to HTML5 packages. I _also_ personally believe this port is blurry ðŸ˜…

Also, I had to make new sprites that weren't in the original game. In this port, you can obtain the Power Croissant no matter which character you use, so I had to make sprites for when Kris or Ralsei picks a weed. I also had to make new box sprites for Kris and Susie, because the second box puzzle would be _literally impossible otherwise_. I'm not _proud_ of these sprites, but they work...? I guess? I hope you enjoy this project regardless!
